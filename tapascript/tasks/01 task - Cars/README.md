# Task by tapascript - cars layout

Hi, Iâ€™m an aspiring self-taught developer currently learning React from **Tapas Da** on the **tapascript Bangla** YouTube channel.
I want to take a moment to express my sincere appreciation and gratitude for the free, in-depth web-development content and courses he provides.

This project is based on a task given in this video:

### **Task Objective**

- Break down the page layout into reusable components.
- Create a component tree based on the hierarchy.
- Replicate the exact layout using React.

I did take some reference from the previous video, but in the end, I successfully completed the task. Huge thanks to **Tapas Da** for the clear and detailed explanation of React concepts.
