Hi, I’m an aspiring self-taught developer currently learning React from **Tapas Da** on the **tapascript Bangla** YouTube channel.
I want to take a moment to express my sincere appreciation and gratitude for the free, in-depth web-development content and courses he provides.

This project is based on a task given in this video:

### **Task Objective**

- Add a + icon at the top-right corner of the page. Everytime clicking on it, add a random user into the UI list that shows in the UI. Note: No UI to create to accept inputs to create this new user. Just use Math.random() along with some Test user name to create it.
- Show the total user count somewhere at the top. It should be updated everytime you add a user.
